        "# Text to summarize which we stole from https://jalammar.github.io/illustrated-transformer/ ;)\n",
        "text = \"\"\"In the previous post, we looked at Attention â€“ a ubiquitous method in modern deep learning models. Attention is a concept that helped improve the performance of neural machine translation applications. In this post, we will look at The Transformer â€“ a model that uses attention to boost the speed with which these models can be trained. The Transformer outperforms the Google Neural Machine Translation model in specific tasks. The biggest benefit, however, comes from how The Transformer lends itself to parallelization. It is in fact Google Cloudâ€™s recommendation to use The Transformer as a reference model to use their Cloud TPU offering. So letâ€™s try to break the model apart and look at how it functions.\n",
        "The Transformer was proposed in the paper Attention is All You Need. A TensorFlow implementation of it is available as a part of the Tensor2Tensor package. Harvardâ€™s NLP group created a guide annotating the paper with PyTorch implementation. In this post, we will attempt to oversimplify things a bit and introduce the concepts one by one to hopefully make it easier to understand to people without in-depth knowledge of the subject matter.\n",
        "Letâ€™s begin by looking at the model as a single black box. In a machine translation application, it would take a sentence in one language, and output its translation in another.\n",
        "Popping open that Optimus Prime goodness, we see an encoding component, a decoding component, and connections between them.\n",
        "The encoding component is a stack of encoders (the paper stacks six of them on top of each other â€“ thereâ€™s nothing magical about the number six, one can definitely experiment with other arrangements). The decoding component is a stack of decoders of the same number.\n",
        "The encoders are all identical in structure (yet they do not share weights). Each one is broken down into two sub-layers:\n",
        "The encoderâ€™s inputs first flow through a self-attention layer â€“ a layer that helps the encoder look at other words in the input sentence as it encodes a specific word. Weâ€™ll look closer at self-attention later in the post.\n",
        "The outputs of the self-attention layer are fed to a feed-forward neural network. The exact same feed-forward network is independently applied to each position.\n",
        "The decoder has both those layers, but between them is an attention layer that helps the decoder focus on relevant parts of the input sentence (similar what attention does in seq2seq models).\n",
        "Now that weâ€™ve seen the major components of the model, letâ€™s start to look at the various vectors/tensors and how they flow between these components to turn the input of a trained model into an output.\n",
        "As is the case in NLP applications in general, we begin by turning each input word into a vector using an embedding algorithm.\n",
        "Each word is embedded into a vector of size 512. We'll represent those vectors with these simple boxes.\n",
        "The embedding only happens in the bottom-most encoder. The abstraction that is common to all the encoders is that they receive a list of vectors each of the size 512 â€“ In the bottom encoder that would be the word embeddings, but in other encoders, it would be the output of the encoder thatâ€™s directly below. The size of this list is hyperparameter we can set â€“ basically it would be the length of the longest sentence in our training dataset.\n",
        "After embedding the words in our input sequence, each of them flows through each of the two layers of the encoder.\n",
        "Here we begin to see one key property of the Transformer, which is that the word in each position flows through its own path in the encoder. There are dependencies between these paths in the self-attention layer. The feed-forward layer does not have those dependencies, however, and thus the various paths can be executed in parallel while flowing through the feed-forward layer.\n",
        "Next, weâ€™ll switch up the example to a shorter sentence and weâ€™ll look at what happens in each sub-layer of the encoder.\n",
        "Now Weâ€™re Encoding!\n",
        "As weâ€™ve mentioned already, an encoder receives a list of vectors as input. It processes this list by passing these vectors into a â€˜self-attentionâ€™ layer, then into a feed-forward neural network, then sends out the output upwards to the next encoder.\n",
