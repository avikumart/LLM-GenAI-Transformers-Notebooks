The goal of **MeasEval** is  the extraction of counts, measurements, and related context from scientific documents. The task is a complex problem that involves solving a number of steps that range from identifying quantities and units of measurement to identify relationships between them. For this assignment, you will focus only on the *Quantity* recognition step:\n",

        "\n",
        "In this assignment, you will have to implement some steps to pre-process and obtain a representation of the data. You will implement a model with an `Embedding` lookup table as the input layer, so the tokens of the input sentences should be represented as indexes. The target labels should also be represented in similar way. Besides, as one would expect, the sentences in the **MeasEval** dataset have different lengths. However, the input for a Deep Learning model is a batch of examples (in this case, sentences) in the form of a single tensor which requires that all examples in the batch must have the same length. Therefore, the sentences should be padded or truncated to a specific length.\n",
        "\n",
        "> **Note!** For this particular task, the `maxlen` value provided to you guarantees that padding is sufficient to make all sentences the same length without the need for truncation.\n",
        "\n",
        "This first of these pre-processing steps will be to obtain both a vocabulary and the set of labels from the train set. The vocabulary should be the list of unique lemmas and must include the special tokens `[PAD]`, that will be used for padding the sequences, and `[UNK]`, that will be used to represent out-of-vocabulary words. Along with the vocabulary and the label set, you will also have to build a dictionary mapping each lemma to its position in the vocabulary and a dictionary mapping each label to its position in the label set. These dictionaries will be used later to obtain the representation of the input and output of the model. The text is already tokenized and lemmatized which will help in this task.\n",
        "\n",
        "You must complete the code for the `get_vocabulary` function that takes as input the `DataFrame` containing the train set. The function should create a list with the all the unique lemmas and include the special tokens `[PAD]` and `[UNK]` in the first two positions. Similarly, the function should create a list with the unique labels with the special token `[PAD]` in the first position. The **pandas** library provides some [functions](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/index.html) that may help you. Along with those lists, `get_vocabulary` should return the dictionaries mapping the lemmas and the labels to their corresponding positions. In total, the vocabulary and the label set should have 5508 and 4 items respectively:\n",
